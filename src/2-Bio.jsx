                    Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cs">Department of Computer Science & Engineering</a> at <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota, Twin Cities</a>, advised by <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~mokbel/">Prof. Mohamed F.

                    My interests are database/big data system internals.
                    I'm particularly interested in system architectures for large scale analytics/transaction workloads, as well as data systems in the distributed/cloud environments.
                    I also find streaming data systems interesting.

                    My researches at UMN usually use spatial data as showcases.
